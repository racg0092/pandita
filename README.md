 Soft and cuddly, yet powerful. Perfect at handling http requests. This is a fun project to learn more in depth how the HTTP protocol works. The goal is to write my own HTTP framework staring at the Transport Layer of the network (TCP)
 and building the HTTP protocol from the gound up myself using the standard specifications.
